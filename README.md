# HelloCG

I'm using version 4.5 of OpenGL in my machine. GLFW can't create a window in 4.6
context, probaly because my drivers dont have this version of OpenGL

### Doubts

* Difference between glBufferStorage and glBufferData?
* vertices[] with position and color, or one array for each attribute?

### Thanks
 * To https://learnopengl.com for share a nice tutorial
